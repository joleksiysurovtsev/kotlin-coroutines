# Coroutines and basic principles.

## Coroutines are from the program.

Coroutines allow you to perform asynchronous operations that can be suspended. And then continue doing it.
Coroutines are often compared to threads, but this is not true since threads are used to organize multitasking.
Coroutines provide only asynchronous operations that are not executed in parallel (although this is possible due to
Kotlin JWM) based on callbacks.

The advantage of coroutines over threads is the ease of switching between them, since no system calls are needed,
or blocking operations. Therefore, coroutines are also called lightweight threads.

Asynchrony is a programming concept when events occur independently of the main thread.
The way of interaction is not sequential, but happens through callbacks.


A coroutine can be stopped by marking the function with the "suspend" keyword.
A suspend function can only be called from a suspension function or a coroutine created with a coroutine builder.

The compiler converts all coroutine code into a state machine resembling a long switch case loop, where each case
corresponds to a call to the suspend function. This approach allows fewer memory objects to be generated at runtime.
applications.

In the Kotlin standard library, only basic functions have been added to organize the work of coroutines. All major features
were added via the `kotlinx.korutines` library: https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines

## Use in your projects

### Gradle

Add dependencies (you can also add other modules you need):
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.6.4")
}
```

And make sure you are using the latest version of Kotlin:
```kotlin
plugins {
    // For build.gradle.kts (Kotlin DSL)
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.6.21"
    
    // For build.gradle (Groovy DSL)
    id ("org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm") version "1.6.21"
}
```

Make sure you have `mavenCentral()` in your repositories list:

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```


Coroutines are called lightweight threads. They use pre-set thread pools and use them smartly and efficiently. 
To suspend keyword suspends the execution of the coroutine, after the coroutine is continued, it can continue its 
execution on any thread from the coroutine dispatcher specified within this coroutine.

This means that traditional single-thread execution guarantees do not work for coroutines.

Coroutines on one thread work efficiently, when the coroutine stops, it does not block the thread, 
but frees up space for another operation.

For example, we can pull data from the database using a coroutine and give it to the user. 
But what if the user interrupted the session while we were getting the data from the database. 
To do this, each coroutine is tied to the ***scope*** lifetime


If you want to stop the java thread, then you wonâ€™t be able to do it right away. For this, you need to execute the 
interact method on the thread, then you need to check the interactive status each time if it is running, then you need 
to stop the operation in the thread yourself. Coroutines work according to the same rules, but with one exception: 
the state of the coroutine is checked before continuing its execution after being interrupted. 
That is, before calling any suspend function, the coroutine can be stopped
